I added distortion, lowshelf, and highshelf. These function exactly as they did in our week 8 exercise.

III.
The sprite class name is just 'sprite', and it creates circles whose speed and size adapt to the sound.

IV.

V.
I made the gradient easier to look at
I made the bars form a circle
I created a 'raining' effect with the circle sprites
I would give that a a 10% / 15%
